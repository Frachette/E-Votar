                    <p class="text-gray-600 text-sm  mb-4">The University collects and processes only the type and amount of data necessary to perform its core and auxiliary functions.

                    </ul>
                    <p class="text-gray-600 text-sm  mb-4">As a premiere research institution, the University may also collect sensitive personal information in the conduct of relevant researches and studies. For instance, a University-affiliated researcher may collect data pertaining to an individual’s ethnic origin, political opinions or criminal history to achieve the objectives of a particular study.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-600 text-sm  mb-4">All personal data collection and processing can only be done when the University acquires the consent of the data subject, either explicitly or implicitly, after the latter has been informed of the nature and extent of data collection and processing.</p>
                    <p class="text-black font-semibold text-sm  mb-4">Why does the University collect and process personal data?</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-600 text-sm  mb-4">The purpose of personal data collection and processing may vary from one University procedure (e.g. student admission, visitor entry, human resource management, etc.) to another. However, the general principle governing the University’s data collection process is legitimacy of purpose.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-600 text-sm  mb-4">The University shall only collect and process data for legitimate purposes in consonance with its inherent functions and in compliance with legal requirements. These legitimate purposes may include, but may not be limited to, the following:</p>
                    <ul class="text-gray-600 text-sm list-disc ml-12 mb-4">
                        <li>To verify students’ and employees’ identity</li>
                        <li>To generate statistics and analytics useful for administrative decisions</li>
                        <li>To strengthen security measures and facilitate investigations of reported violations</li>
                        <li>To easily generate statutory reports</li>
                    </ul>
                    <ul class="text-gray-600 text-sm list-disc ml-12 mb-4">
                        <li>For employee and human resources management purposes (as may be required by applicable laws)</li>
                        <li>For research purposes or endeavors contributing to the body of knowledge</li>
                        <li>To comply with legal or regulatory obligations</li>
                        <li>To establish, exercise, or defend legal claims</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="text-black font-semibold text-sm  mb-4">How does the University share or disclose personal data?</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-600 text-sm  mb-4">Utmost care and due diligence are practiced by the University in handling personal data. The University shall never share or disclose data to third-parties without prior consent from the data subjects. Whenever disclosure of data is necessary and permitted, the University conscientiously reviews the privacy and security policies of the authorized third-party service providers or external partners. The University may also be required to disclose data in compliance with legal or regulatory obligations.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-600 text-sm mb-4">Internal disclosure of personal data from one University entity to another shall be subjected to an institutionalized standard data request procedure. This ensures that data is transmitted through official channels and shared for legitimate purposes.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-600 text-sm  mb-4">Regardless of the context of data disclosure, the University shall always practice the principle of data minimization which means that only the minimum amount of data needed to serve a particular purpose is shared to the requesting entity.</p>

                    <p class="text-black font-semibold text-sm  mb-4">How does the University protect personal data?</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-600 text-sm  mb-4">The University shall employ necessary or reasonable safeguards in the form of physical, technological, logical and administrative controls. Internal access to stored personal data will be kept to a minimum number of authorized individuals and bounded by confidentiality agreements. These individuals are subjected to regular training for proper handling of information in accordance to the University’s data privacy policies and other related laws, regulations or issuances.</p>

                    <p class="text-black font-semibold text-sm mb-4">How long does the University retain personal data?</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-600 text-sm  mb-4">Personal data are retained only for as long as necessary to serve its declared purpose or comply with regulatory and legal requirements. Depending on the nature of data and purpose it serves, the retention period could range from days (e.g. CCTV recording) to years (e.g. student academic information). Whenever retention becomes unnecessary, the University shall dispose the personal data properly through a secure and confidential means.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-600 text-sm  mb-4">For concerns and inquiries relating to the University Data Privacy, please don't hesitate to contact the University Data Privacy Officer, Ms. Dessa L.
